Jimmy was a frog who became a princess.  He croaking in a pond that smelled really
bad until one day a prince showed up. The prince was transgender and had an animal
fetish.  Jimmy jumped out of the pond into the prince's pocket.

He took a stroll in the princes pocket for a while before the arrived at the princes castle.  
At the castle, Jimmy hopped out and landed on the large dining room table.  It was luxurious:
there were seats for twenty with a 3 course meal on its way.
